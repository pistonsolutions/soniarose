Pour Twilio + CRM, je veux :
– un numéro Twilio relié au CRM
– pouvoir envoyer des textos automatisés
– que les suivis partent selon les réponses des formulaires
– et que je puisse répondre manuellement au besoin.

J’imagine que c’est une configuration que vous faites déjà régulièrement, donc je veux m’assurer qu’on est sur la même longueur d’onde et que tout est clair pour vous de votre côté avant qu’on avance
Vous avez dit :
CRM will be our proprietarysetup. the website will be custom. for the CRM/SMS we will make it so we get a new number for her and she can operate on it it will be automated down the line but right now it will be mostly her.

create the feature list as if you were a CTO. you care about how the client's vision will do and you will make sure every ambiguity is figured out. this list sohuld be objectively interpreted by downstream engineers. understood?
Vous avez dit :
the crm and infra should be built first. the five days of joy workflow should be implemented. non-AI video sending should be implemented. birthday ideo as well and the twilio number essentially we just get one number that's it. and then from there on the lady only wants to operate on those numbers manually so call and text. not sure how she would be able to use that on her phone though?
