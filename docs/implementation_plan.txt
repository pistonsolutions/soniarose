1. PHASE 1 — CRM + INFRASTRUCTURE (FOUNDATION)
1.1 CRM CAPABILITIES REQUIRED before any workflows

This MUST exist first because workflows depend entirely on:

Contact model

name

phone

email

tags

emotional profile

birthday

lead source

timeline events

pipeline stage

opt-in/opt-out status (STOP)

Messaging model

inbound SMS

outbound SMS

delivery receipts

STOP/HELP compliance events

Workflow engine (minimal)

Trigger conditions

Action queue

Execution runner

Retry logic

Media handling

Client video upload to object storage

Generate stable URLs for sending

Twilio integration layer

Single dedicated number

Inbound handler

Outbound sender

Call forwarding

Call logs

✅ 2. SINGLE TWILIO NUMBER — HOW IT WORKS

The client (“the lady”) will get one Twilio phone number.
It is used for:

SMS sending (manual + automated)

SMS receiving

Phone calls (inbound → forwarded to her real phone)

Call logs in CRM

2.1 Outbound SMS

Sent from inside the CRM (desktop/mobile browser).

2.2 Inbound SMS

Received in the CRM inbox.

2.3 How can she text from her phone?

There are 2 options:

Option A — CRM Mobile Web App (recommended)

She logs into the CRM on her phone browser

She sends/receives messages through the CRM

Messages go OUT via Twilio

Messages come IN via Twilio → CRM → her interface

This is the safest and preserves your architecture + IP.

Option B — Call Forwarding Only (SMS not forwarded to personal phone)

Inbound calls go to her real phone.
But SMS is never forwarded to her real number (Twilio doesn’t support native forwarding in Canada without coding workarounds).

This ensures:

compliance

correct message logging

NO leakage of sender identity via personal number

🚫 What she cannot do

She cannot reply to SMS from her personal phone app.

Because:

carriers rewrite the number

compliance breaks

CRM loses the message trace

STOP/HELP events cannot be caught

automation breaks

This is standard in all CRM + Twilio systems (GoHighLevel, Close.io, etc.).

✅ 3. PHASE 2 — WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION

The CRM must support three workflows out of the gate:

3.1 Five Days of Joy Automation (Full Spec)

Triggers:

New contact enters pipeline

OR emotional questionnaire submitted

OR custom tag applied (Day0_Trigger)

Action chain:

Day 0

Send welcome SMS + PDF link (PDF pre-uploaded)
Tag: “Joy_Day0_Sent”

Day 1

Send nurturing SMS
Tag: “Joy_Day1_Sent”

Day 2

Send insight SMS
Tag: “Joy_Day2_Sent”

Day 3

Send resource SMS
Tag: “Joy_Day3_Sent”

Day 4

Send relationship-builder SMS
Tag: “Joy_Day4_Sent”

Day 5

Send CTA SMS
Tag: “Joy_Final_Sent”

Technical notes:

Must support time-of-day windows (e.g., send between 10AM–6PM local)

Must detect STOP (opt-out) and cancel the workflow

Must support per-contact pause/resume

3.2 Birthday Video Automation

Trigger:

Daily cron job checks: contact.birthday == today

Actions:

Send SMS:
“Happy Birthday! 🎉 [Video link]”

If Messenger ID exists → send Messenger version

Log completion event

Prevent duplicate sends (store last_birthday_sent_year)

Video Logic:

Client manually uploads one real pre-recorded video

Stored in stable S3 bucket

CRM simply attaches the link

3.3 Non-AI Video Sending

Usage:

Agents sends a video manually

Workflow sends a video automatically

Birthday workflow uses the same infrastructure

Technical Implementation:

Upload endpoint: /api/media/upload-video

File stored as: /videos/{client_id}/{uuid}.mp4

Links expiring or permanent (you choose security vs simplicity)

Twilio SMS sends URL in the message

📱 4. HOW THE CLIENT WILL OPERATE DAY-TO-DAY
Daily Operation for the Client

Open CRM on phone or laptop

See conversations (SMS inbox)

Click a contact and reply manually

See missed calls

Respond to leads

Let workflow handle 5-Day and Birthday sends

Phone Calls

Inbound call → Twilio forwards → her personal phone rings

CRM logs call metadata

She answers normally

This is the simplest operational workflow, identical to HighLevel, Close, and FollowUpBoss.

🎯 5. WHAT ENGINEERS MUST DELIVER (NON-AMBIGUOUS LIST)
CRM Infrastructure

Multi-tenant DB layer

Contact engine

Conversation engine

Workflow engine

Twilio integration

Pipelines

Timeline logging

Delivery status handler

Workflows

Five Days of Joy
